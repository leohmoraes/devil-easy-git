A set of bash scripts to easy the life of git users


With these scripts you can easy your git life. For example: 

git-commit: With these script you can perform all the process of send a modification to the server at once. It makes an add, commit and push, taking care of not failing merges too.



git-submodules-*

This set of scripts mocks the git-submoules functionality by including a git project inside another, it uses the same config files as a git-submodule original feature but it is completly independent and bug free - as we know a very weak part of git is it submodule support.

for example: getting a git submodules config file git-submodules-add will setup all projects inside the specified folder descript on .gitmodules file.




For more details on each script you can use script --help or see the code :).

Fell free to feedback or open a issues.
